 MODULE 5 ASSIGNMENT

The purpose of this assignment is to manipulate a given class Rectangle to create, convert to string, shift, and offset the rectangle. 

Starting at line 5

The first step of this is to establish the class and method for the code. Being that we are trying to manipulate a rectangle we need to give an origin point for the rectangle as a reference point for the manipulations to start from. An important aspect to mention is the usage of self in Python. Self represents the instance of the class. By using the 'self' we are able to access the attributes and methods of the class in Python binding the attributes with the given argument. 

Starting at line 35

Below is a section of functions that are responsible for testing if the shifting, offsetting, and so on. We must first establish the parameters for each of the variables to create the triangle. Following we can turn the function into a string and then manipulate the rectangle to move as directed in the instructions.
